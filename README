NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::DarkPAN - Depend on things from arbitrary
    places-not-CPAN

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
    From time to time, people find themselves in want to depending on
    something that isn't from CPAN, but their team/in-house crew want a
    painless way to depend on it anyway.

      [Prereqs::DarkPAN]
      DDG = http://some.example.org/path/to/DDG.tar.gz
      ; optional
      DDG.minversion = 0.4.0

    This would provide to various user commands the knowledge that
    DDG.tar.gz was wanted to provide the package DDG.

    Our hope is one day you can just do

      # Doesn't work yet :(
      $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps )

      or

      $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps --missing )

    and have it do the right things.

    In the interim, you can do

        $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps )  \
          && cpanm $( dzil listdeps_darkpan )

    or

        $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps --missing ) \
          && cpanm $( dzil listdeps_darkpan --missing )

    and have it work.
