NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::DarkPAN - Depend on things from arbitrary
    places-not-CPAN

VERSION
    version 0.2.2

SYNOPSIS
    From time to time, people find themselves in want to depending on
    something that isn't from CPAN, but their team/in-house crew want a
    painless way to depend on it anyway.

      [Prereqs::DarkPAN]
      DDG = http://adarkpan.example.org/  ; DarkPAN Base URI
      ; optional
      DDG.minversion = 0.4.0
      ; optional
      ; But likely to be substantially faster.
      DDG.uri = /path/to/foo/bar.tar.gz

    This would provide to various user commands the knowledge that
    DDG.tar.gz was wanted to provide the package DDG.

    Our hope is one day you can just do

      # Doesn't work yet :(
      $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps )

      or
      # Doesn't work yet :(
      $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps --missing )

    and have it do the right things.

    In the interim, you can do

        $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps )  \
          && cpanm $( dzil listdeps_darkpan )

    or

        $ cpanm $( dzil listdeps --missing ) \
          && cpanm $( dzil listdeps_darkpan --missing )

    and have it work.

DarkPAN Configurations.
  A Simple HTTP Server
    The easiest DarkPAN-ish thing that this module supports is na√Øve HTTP
    Servers, by simply setting the server and path to the resource.

      [Prereqs::DarkPAN]
      Foo = http://my.server/
      Foo.uri =  files/foo.tar.gz

    You can specify an optional minimum version parameter "minversion" as a
    client-side check to make sure they haven't installed an older version
    of Foo.

    This "uri" will be reported to listdeps_darkpan with minimal
    modification, only expanding relative paths to absolute ones so tools
    like "cpanm" can use them.

  A MicroCPAN Configuration
    There is a newly formed system for creating "proper" cpans which only
    contain a handful of modules. For these services you can simply do

      [Prereqs::DarkPAN]
      Foo = http://my.server/

    And we'll fire up all sorts of magic to get the
    "02packages.details.tar.gz" file, shred it, and try installing 'Foo'
    from there.

  Heavier CPAN configurations
    The 3rd use case is when you have somewhat heavy-weight private CPANs
    where you don't want to be encumbered by the weight of downloading and
    parsing "02packages.details.tar.gz". If you have a full cpan clone with
    a few modules stuffed into it, and you only want those stuffed modules
    while using normal CPAN ( because the cloned versions from cpan are now
    old ), its possibly better to use the original notation

      [Prereqs::DarkPAN]
      Foo = http://my.server/
      Foo.uri = path/too/foo.tar.gz

    As it will only fetch the file specified instead of relying on
    "02packages.details.tar.gz"

    Granted, this latter approach will bind again to downloading a specific
    version of the prerequisite, but this is still here for you if you need
    it.
